## Description
------
I wanted to try my hand at creating a full-stack application fromt he ground up. I've studied MVC principles for a while, and decided this would be a great way to practice what I had learned. I also felt this app would make a great addition to my  portfolio due to its size and complexity. 

To exercise/test my knowledge of MVC, I made sure this app included a framwork that I wasn't as familiar with, a backend DB, and Sequelize for the model structure. I really wanted to stay as close to using JS for the entire app as possible, and it turned out great, and definitely gave me a better understanding of how to use JS for interacting with the DB.

The app itself allows users to post information/blogs. The original intent is for these posts to be tech related. Users can also go on and make comments on current posts. 

Creating this application really strengthened my understanding of Sequelize, and the MVC paradigm. It was great to be able to tackle the problem one portion at a time. Although this application doesn't use React, the MVC process definitely made creating this app more enjoyable. I also gained a deeper understanding of Sequelize, to the point to where I much prefer working with it over writing SQL statements. My experience with the Materialize framework was also strengthened. This was great, because when I used Materialize on a previous project, I didn't really like it. I really struggled with creating modals with the framework.
